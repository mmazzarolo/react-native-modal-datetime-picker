This library exposes a cross-platform interface for showing the native date-picker and time-picker inside a modal, providing a unified user and developer experience.

Under the hood, this library is using [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker).

## Setup (for non-Expo projects)

If your project is not using [Expo](https://expo.io/), install the library and the community date/time picker using npm or yarn:

```bash
# using npm
$ npm i react-native-modal-datetime-picker @react-native-community/datetimepicker

# using yarn
$ yarn add react-native-modal-datetime-picker @react-native-community/datetimepicker
```

Please notice that the `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` package is a native module so [**it might require manual linking**](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker#getting-started).

## Setup (for Expo projects)

If your project is using [Expo](https://expo.io/), install the library and the community date/time picker using the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/):

```bash
npx expo install react-native-modal-datetime-picker @react-native-community/datetimepicker
```

To ensure the picker theme respects the device theme, you should also configure the appearance styles in your `app.json` this way:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic"
  }
}
```

Refer to the [Appearance](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/appearance/) documentation on [Expo](https://expo.io/) for more info.

## Usage

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button, View } from "react-native";
import DateTimePickerModal from "react-native-modal-datetime-picker";

const Example = () => {
  const [isDatePickerVisible, setDatePickerVisibility] = useState(false);

  const showDatePicker = () => {
    setDatePickerVisibility(true);
  };

  const hideDatePicker = () => {
    setDatePickerVisibility(false);
  };

  const handleConfirm = (date) => {
    console.warn("A date has been picked: ", date);
    hideDatePicker();
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Show Date Picker" onPress={showDatePicker} />
      <DateTimePickerModal
        isVisible={isDatePickerVisible}
        mode="date"
        onConfirm={handleConfirm}
        onCancel={hideDatePicker}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default Example;
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

This repo is only maintained by me, and unfortunately I don't have enough time for dedicated support & question.
If you're experiencing issues, please check the FAQs below.  
For questions and support, please start [try starting a discussion](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/discussions) or try asking it on [StackOverflow](stackoverflow).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Please use [the GitHub issues](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues) only for well-described and reproducible bugs. Question/support issues will be closed.**

### The component is not working as expected, what should I do?

Under the hood `react-native-modal-datetime-picker` uses [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker).
If you're experiencing issues, try swapping `react-native-datetime-picker` with [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker). If the issue persists, check if it has already been reported as a an issue or check the other FAQs.

### How can I show the timepicker instead of the datepicker?

Set the `mode` prop to `time`.
You can also display both the datepicker and the timepicker in one step by setting the `mode` prop to `datetime`.

### Why is the initial date not working?

Please make sure you're using the `date` props (and not the `value` one).

### Can I use the new iOS 14 style for the date/time picker?

Yes!  
You can set the `display` prop (that we'll pass down to [`react-native-datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-datetimepicker/datetimepicker)) to `inline` to use the new iOS 14 picker.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./.github/images/datetimepicker-ios-inline.png" height="400" />
</p>

> Please notice that you should probably avoid using this new style with a time-only picker (so with `mode` set to `time`) because it doesn't suit well this use case.

### Why does the picker show up twice on Android?

This seems to be a known issue of the [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker/issues/54). Please see [this thread](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker/issues/54) for a couple of workarounds. The solution, as described in [this reply](https://github.com/react-native-datetimepicker/datetimepicker/issues/54#issuecomment-618776550) is hiding the modal, **before doing anything else**.

<details><summary><strong>Example of solution using Input + DatePicker</strong></summary>
<p>
The most common approach for solving this issue when using an <code>Input</code> is:
<ul>
  <li>Wrap your <code>Input</code> with a "<code>Pressable</code>"/<code>Button</code> (<code>TouchableWithoutFeedback</code>/<code>TouchableOpacity</code> + <code>activeOpacity={1}</code> for example)</li>
  <li>Prevent <code>Input</code> from being focused. You could set <code>editable={false}</code> too for preventing Keyboard opening</li>
  <li>Triggering your <code>hideModal()</code> callback as a first thing inside <code>onConfirm</code>/<code>onCancel</code> callback props</li>
</ul>

```jsx
const [isVisible, setVisible] = useState(false);
const [date, setDate] = useState('');

<TouchableOpacity
  activeOpaticy={1}
  onPress={() => setVisible(true)}>
  <Input
    value={value}
    editable={false} // optional
  />
</TouchableOpacity>
<DatePicker
  isVisible={isVisible}
  onConfirm={(date) => {
    setVisible(false); // <- first thing
    setValue(parseDate(date));
  }}
  onCancel={() => setVisible(false)}
/>
```

</p>
</details>

### How can I allow picking only specific dates?

You can't ‚Äî [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker) doesn't allow you to do so. That said, you can allow only "range" of dates by setting a minimum and maximum date. See below for more info.

### How can I set a minimum and/or maximum date?

You can use the [`minimumDate`](https://github.com/react-native-datetimepicker/datetimepicker#minimumdate-optional) and [`maximumDate`](https://github.com/react-native-datetimepicker/datetimepicker#maximumdate-optional) props from [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker).

### How do I change the color of the Android date and time pickers?

This is more a React-Native specific question than a react-native-modal-datetime-picker one.  
See issue [#29](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/29) and [#106](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/106) for some solutions.

### How to set a 24-hours format in iOS?

The `is24Hour` prop is only available on Android but you can use a small hack for enabling it on iOS by setting the picker timezone to `en_GB`:

```js
<DatePicker
  mode="time"
  locale="en_GB" // Use "en_GB" here
  date={new Date()}
/>
```

### How can I change the picker language/locale?

Under the hood this library is using [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker). You can't change the language/locale from `react-native-modal-datetime-picker`. Locale/language is set at the native level, on the device itself.

### How can I set an automatic locale in iOS?

On iOS, you can set an automatic detection of the locale (`fr_FR`, `en_GB`, ...) depending on the user's device locale.
To do so, edit your `AppDelegate.m` file and add the following to `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`.

```objc
// Force DatePicker locale to current language (for: 24h or 12h format, full day names etc...)
NSString *currentLanguage = [[NSLocale preferredLanguages] firstObject];
[[UIDatePicker appearance] setLocale:[[NSLocale alloc]initWithLocaleIdentifier:currentLanguage]];
```

### Why is the picker is not showing the right layout on iOS >= 14?

Please make sure you're on the latest version of `react-native-modal-datetime-picker` and of the [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker).
[We already closed several iOS 14 issues that were all caused by outdated/cached versions of the community datetimepicker](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues?q=%22ios+14%22).

### Why is the picker not visible/transparent on iOS?

Please make sure you're on the latest version of `react-native-modal-datetime-picker` and of [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker).
Also, double-check that the picker light/dark theme is aligned with the OS one (e.g., don't "force" a theme using `isDarkModeEnabled`).

### Why can't I show an alert after the picker has been hidden (on iOS)?

Unfortunately this is a know issue with React-Native on iOS. Even by using the `onHide` callback exposed by `react-native-modal-datetime-picker` you might not be able to show the (native) alert successfully. The only workaround that seems to work consistently for now is to wrap showing the alter in a setTimeout üòî:

```js
const handleHide = () => {
  setTimeout(() => Alert.alert("Hello"), 0);
};
```

See issue [#512](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/512) for more info.

### Why does the date of `onConfirm` not match the picked date (on iOS)?

On iOS, clicking the "Confirm" button while the spinner is still in motion ‚Äî even just _slightly_ in motion ‚Äî will cause the `onConfirm` callback to return the initial date instead of the picked one. This is is a long standing iOS issue (that can happen even on native app like the iOS calendar) and there's no failproof way to fix it on the JavaScript side.  
See [this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/SudoPlz/6959001879fbfcc7e2aa42a428a5265c) for an example of how it might be solved at the native level ‚Äî but keep in mind it won't work on this component until it has been merged into the official React-Native repo.

Related issue in the React-Native repo [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/8169).

### How do I make it work with snapshot testing?

See issue [#216](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/216) for a possible workaround.
